The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
When you reach the end of your rope, tie a knot in it and hang on
Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant
Whoever is happy will make others happy too
You will face many defeats in life, but never let yourself be defeated
Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough
Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life
